## Deviations:

        * View a profile through Messages (Still figuring out custom navigation)
        * Card swiping/Running out of cards showing a map from the Home view
        * Login segue to Swipe
    * Profile TableView not fully functional (** Fix today @Mich & Pearl)
    * Edit profile/Viewing profile hooked up to Firebase (** Fix today @Mich & Pearl)
    * Note: Account creation/Login -- alerts/user error checking are not functional due to a Window hierarchy problem. However, we included debugging in beta, and if done correctly, account creation and login are fully functional.
